1. Let x be even.  By definition, x = 2y for some y.  If x != 0, then 
x - 1 = 2y - 1 = 2(y - 1) + 1.  (The natural y - 1 exists because y != 0, as if 
y = 0 were true x would also be 0.)  So x - 1 is one greater than double a 
natural, and so by definition is odd.

2. Let x be odd.  By definition, x = 2y + 1 for some y.  So x - 1 = 2y
and is even by the definition.

3. Let x - 1 be odd.  By definition, x - 1 = 2y + 1 for some y.  So x =
2y + 2 = 2(y + 1) and is even by definition.

4. Let x - 1 be even.  By definition, x - 1 = 2y for some y.  So x = 
2y + 1 and is odd by definition.

5. Assume that there exists a number that is neither even nor odd.  By the
Least Number Axiom, let z be the smallest number that is neither even nor 
odd.  It is not possible that z = 0, since 0 = 2(0) is even.   So z must
have a predecessor z - 1.  This z - 1 cannot be even, since then z would have
to be odd, and it isn't.  Similarly z - 1 cannot be odd, since then z would
have to be even, and it isn't.  This means that z - 1 is neither even nor 
odd, which is a contradiction because z is supposed to be the smallest number
that is neither even nor odd.  The assumption leads to a contradiction and so
must be false.

6.  Again assume that some number is both even and odd, and let z be the 
smallest such number.  Again z cannot be 0, because 0 is not odd (it cannot
be equal to 2y + 1 for any _natural_ y).  So z has a predecessor z - 1.  Then
z - 1 is even because z is odd, and it is odd because z is even.  It is thus
both even and odd, contradicting the assumption that z is the least such number.
