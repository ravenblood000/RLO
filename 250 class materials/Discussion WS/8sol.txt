COMPSCI 250 Fall 2023 Discussion #8 Solutions

EE is the set of strings over {a, b} that have both an even number of a's and an
even number of b's.

EEP is the subset of EE consisting of non-empty strings that cannot be "factored"
as the concatenation of two non-empty strings that are both in EE.

We observe that the two-letter strings in EEP are aa and bb.

The four-letter strings are abab, abba, baab, and baba.

The six-letter strings are abaaab, abaaba, abbbab, abbbba, baaaab, baaaba, 
babbab, and babbba.

In general, except for aa and bb, a string in EEP must follow these rules:

1) the first two letters must be different
2) the middle letters consist of aa and bb pairs
3) the last two letters must be different

We can capture these rules by the regular expression (ab + ba)(aa + bb)^*(ab + ba).

This makes EEP the language of the expression "aa + bb + (ab + ba)(aa + bb)^*(ab + ba)".

And EE is the star of EEP, for the following reason -- clearly any concatenation
of zero or more strings in EEP will be in EE, because the number of a's or the number
of b's in any such string is the sum of even numbers, which is even.  And any string
in EE can be factored into strings in EEP, because a string in EE is either in EEP 
or can be factored into two shorter strings.
