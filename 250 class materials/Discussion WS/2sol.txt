COMPSCI 250 Fall 2023 Discussion #2 Solutions:

Question 1: Premises are:

(I) c --> p
(II) p --> not (b or c)
(III) (not b) --> (p and k)
(IV) (not c) --> (b and not k)

Assume c.		for Proof by Cases
p			MP, I
not (b or c)		MP, II
not b and not c		DeMorgan
not c			Right Separation
c and not c		Conjunction with line 1
0			Excluded middle (plus DeMorgan)

Since we derived 0 from c, c must be false

not c			Conclusion of Proof by Contradiction
b and not k		MP, IV
(b or c) --> not p	Contrapositive of II
b or c			Separation from "b and not k", joining
not p			MP from above
b and not c and not k and not p
			Conjunction

I, II, III are satisfied vacuously, IV is satisfied trivially.



Question 2: Premises are:

(I) c --> (k and m)
(II) (not p or s) --> (b or c)
(III) (p and c) --> not m
(IV) (not s) --> (p or not k)
(V) b --> (not k and not p)
(VI) not (s and k) --> c

Assume c.		for Proof by Cases
k and m			MP, 1
m			Right separation
m --> not(p and c)	Contrapositive of III
not(p and c)		MP
not p or not c		DeMorgan
c --> not p		Definition of Implication
not p			MP
not p and k		Conjunction
not (p or not k)	DeMorgan
not (p or not k) --> s  Contrapositive of IV
s			MP
k			separation from line 2
k or p			joining
not (not k and not p)   DeMorgan
not (not k and not p) --> not b
			Contrapositive of V
not b			MP
not b and c and k and m and not p and s
			Conjunction

I and II satisfied trivially, III, IV, V, VI vacuously.

It remains to check the case of "not c"

not c			for Proof by Cases
not c --> (s and k)	Contrapositive of VI
s and k			MP
s			separation
not p or s		joining
b or c			MP from II
not c --> b		Definition of Implication
b			MP
(not k and not p)	MP from V
not k			separation
k			separation from line 3 of this case
k and not k		conjunction
0			excluded middle

Since "not c" leads to a contradiction, c must be true, and the solution
found in the c case is the only possible solution.
