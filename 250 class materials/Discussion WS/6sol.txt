COMPSCI 250 Fall 2023: Solutions to Discussion #6

(a) Let P(n) be “F(n) and F(n+1) are relatively prime”.

Base: F(1) = 1, F(2) = 1, 1 and 1 are relatively prime.

Inductive step: P(n) —> P(n+1).  I have three proofs of the IS. 

Proof 1: Here we choose to prove (not P(n+1)) —> (not P(n)).
If F(n+1) and F(n+2) are not relatively prime, then some natural
g with g > 1 divides both F(n+1) and F(n+2).  But then g also 
divided F(n+2) - F(n+1) = F(n), so it divides both F(n) and
F(n+1) and P(n) is false.

Proof 2: Assume that the EA goes to 1 on inputs F(n+1) and F(n).
(We know that this happens if and only if those numbers are 
relatively prime.)  Run the EA on inputs F(n+2) and F(n+1).  The 
first remainder F(n+2) % F(n+1) is F(n), so the second step of 
this run of the EA has inputs F(n+1) and F(n), and thus goes to
1 by the EH.  So P(n+1) is true.

Proof 3: The Inverse Theorem says that x has an inverse mod y if
and only if x and y are relatively prime.  So the IH says that F(n)
has an inverse mod F(n+1) and vice versa.  But modulo F(n+1), F(n+2)
is congruent to F(n), since F(n) = F(n+2) - F(n+1).  So either both
F(n) and F(n+2) have inverses modulo F(n+1), or neither do.  The IH
says it is both, which by the Inverse Theorem again tells us that
P(n+1) is true.



(b) For the base case of n = 0, removing a point triangle from a
triangle of side 1 leaves an empty figure, which can be tiled with
0 trapezoids.

For the inductive case, we assume that any triangle of side 2^n, with
one point triangle missing, can be tiled with trapezoids.  Again I 
have three proofs of the inductive step.

Proof 1 (the intended one): Take any triangle of side 2^{n+1} with
one point triangle missing.  Place a single trapezoid with its longest
side centered on the side of the big triangle opposite the missing point.
Draw a triangle connecting the three midpoints of the sides of the original
big triangle, thus dividing this triangle into four triangles of side 2^n.
One of these contains the point taken from the big triangle, and the other
three each contain one of the small triangles of the trapezoid.  This means
that all four can be tiled with trapezoids, by the IH, and combining these
tilings with the single trapezoid tiles the original figure.

Proof 2:  Orient the missing point at the top, and draw a horizontal 
line halfway up the original triangle to divide it into a triangle of 
side 2^n with one point missing, and a trapezoid with shorter side 2^n.
The former can be tiled by the IH.  By a separate induction, we can show
that any trapezoid similar to our size-3 ties, but with shorter side 2^k
for any natural k, can be tiled with size-3 trapezoids.  The base case of 
size 2^0 is obvious as we are tiling the figure with one copy of itself.
For the induction, note that a trapezoid of side 2^{n+1} can be divided 
into four trapezoids of side 2^n as follows (ASCII art requires a constant-width
font):

________
\ \__/ /
 \/__\/

Proof 3:  Place one size-3 trapezoid next to the missing point, to make 
a side 2^{n+1} triangle missing a point triangle of side 2.  This figure is 
a double-sized copy of a triangle of side 2^n with an ordinary missing point
of side 1.  By the IH, it can be tiled by double-sized trapezoids (of size 12).
Each of these trapezoids may be tiled with four size-3 trapezoids as per the
figure above.



(c) P(n) = “Any rectangle with n total lines and circles may be 2-colored”.

Base: Making the rectangle either color suffices.

Given a rectangle with n+1 circles and lines, consider the figure made by
the first n circles and lines.  By the IH, this can be two-colored.  Add
the last circle or line to it, which divides some of the regions into two.
Pick one side of the circle or line, and reverse the colors of all the regions
on that side.  We claim that the result is a valid two-coloring of the new
figure.  To prove this, let R and S be arbitrary regions of the new figure 
that share a border.  If they shared a border before, they were on the same 
side of the new line or circle and so were both reversed or both unchanged.
By the IH they had different colors before, so they still have different 
colors.  If they did not share a border before, their border was created by 
the new line or circle, so they are on opposite sides and one was reversed
and the other wasn’t.  So either way, they have opposite colors now.  Since
R and S were arbitrary, every such pair of regions has opposite colors and
the new coloring is a valid 2-coloring.



(d) P(n) = “Any tournament graph with n nodes has a Hamilton path”, where
“tournament graph” means a directed graph where each pair of distinct 
vertices has an arc from one to the other but not both. and a “Hamilton
path” is a path from some vertex to some other vertex that includes each
vertex exactly once.

Base: n = 2, there is an edge from one vertex to the other, and this is the 
desired path.

Induction: Consider an arbitrary tournament graph with n+1 vertices.
Let x be one of the vertices, and let a_1,…, a_n be the other vertices in
the order of the path that we know to exist by the IH. For each i, x has an
edge to a_i or from a_i but not both.

Case 1: x has an edge to a_1.  We add x as the new first vertex of the path.

Case 2: x has an edge from a_n.  We add x as the new last vertex.

Case 3: There is some i such that x has an edge from a_i and an edge to a_{i+1}.
(This must happen if there is an edge from a_1 and an edge to a_n.)  In this
case we insert x into the path between a_i and a_{i+1}.
