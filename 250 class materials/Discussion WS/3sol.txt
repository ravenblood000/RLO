COMPSCI 250 Fall 2023 Discussion #3 Solutions

1) Goal is to prove that h is onto, which means:

for all z: exists x: h(x) = z

We let c be an arbitrary element of Z.

Since g is onto, we have:

for all z: exists y: g(y) = z

which by Specification gives us

exists y: g(y) = c

We instantiate b as the element of Y given, so we get

g(b) = c

Now since f is onto, we have

for all y: exists x: f(x) = y

We specify this to y = b to get

exists x: f(x) = b

and instantiate x as a to get 

f(a) = b.

Now since f(a) = b and g(b) = c, we have h(a) = c.

By Existence, exists x: h(x) = c.

Since c was arbitrary, we have for all z: exists x: h(x) = z as desired.



2) We want to prove 

for all x: R(x, x), 

so we let a be an arbitrary element of type A.

By the additional premise, specifying to a, we have

exists y: R(a, y)

Instantiating y to b gives us R(a, b).

Specifying the symmetric property to a and b gives us

R(a, b) --> R(b, a)

Specifying the transitive property to x = a, y = b, z = a gives

(R(a, b) and R(b, a)) --> R(a, a)

By Modus Ponens twice we get R(a, a) for our arbitrary a,
completing our generalization.


3) We want to prove:

forall x forall y: (T(x, y) and T(y, x)) --> (x = y)

Let a and b be arbitrary elements of A and assume "T(a, b) and T(b, a)".

Specifying the definition of T to a and b, then to b and a, gives us

T(a, b) <--> (R(a, b) and S(a, b)
T(b, a) <--> (R(b, a) and S(b, a)

Substitution gives us 

R(a, b) and S(a, b) and R(b, a) and S(b, a)

Commutativity and separation gives us

R(a, b) and R(b, a).

By specifying the antisymmetry of R to a and b we get

(R(a, b) and R(b, a)) --> (a = b)

So Modus Ponens gets us a = b.  Since we proved this 
from the assumption "T(a, b) and T(b, a)", we have
proved the desired implication for a and b, and since
a and b were arbitrary we have proved the desired quantified 
statement.
